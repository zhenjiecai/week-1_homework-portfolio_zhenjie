	<p>
		I am a passionate User Experience Designer at BBH London. I am attached to quality and details, in translating customersâ€™ needs with engaging and usable solutions. I enjoy designing across media, interpreting and listening to users, achieving explicit outcomes and goals, and presenting my work. Born in China, I studied and worked between Shanghai and London, bringing influences from various cultures in my work. I am always developing my practice and applying new skills in user centered design.
